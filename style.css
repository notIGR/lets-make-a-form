/* 
  --- Welcome to the form challenge ---
  -------------------------------------
  Currently, we are lacking in the styles department,
  but lucky for you, your designer has given you some resources.
  You are to make this page look like 
  WITHOUT modifying ANY HTML.

  Thankfully, we don't have to use any nasty @imports for the fonts,
  (Lato is already imported in HTML so you can use it in CSS font-family)
  and I've gone ahead and color slurped the colors for you.

  Theme:
  Primary - #f6f6f6
  Secondary-100: #000000
  Secondary-200: #696969
  Secondary-300: #212121


  I'd like to see them used as variables as we may change them in
  the future ðŸ‘€
  
  Here is a link on how to create / use CSS variables
